Today E made small <a href="/tags/popover">popovers</a> for lunch. We forgot to take pictures, but here's one from the internet that looks close enough. 
{% include images/popovers.jfif %}

For dinner it was papaya salad, pork larb, lettuce wraps, and rice. This is a nice reasonably healthy meal that's still fun to eat. Some notes:
- turkey larb (ie a leaner meat) works just fine; the extra fat isn't necessary
- papaya was bitter, presumably bc of the fruit itself. next time could try tasting beforehand and blanching or something.
- lettuce wraps work well and rice isn't super necessary.
- a weird idea is to try combining these things w/ spring roll toppings and making rice paper wraps.
